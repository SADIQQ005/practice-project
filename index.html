          <img class="img_name" src="/images/linkedIn.webp" alt="">
        </div>
        <p>“I’ve learned how vital it is to create a strong company foundation, implement proper
          processes and concurrently, and respectfully, involve people right from the start – without
          this, executives and projects are vulnerable.”</p>
        <span>A hands-on senior executive, Ineke has over 25 years’ telecoms experience at CXO, CEO and at Board
          level and has succeeded where many would have thrown in the towel. Physical risk, natural disaster,
          and malpractice have been regular challenges for Ineke, who has a ‘focus forward’ approach to her
          work.

          Tolerance, determination and tenacity characterise this Dutch national and are traits that have
          helped her deliver significant revenue successes in some of the world’s most troubled spots.

          Ineke transfers knowledge from complex postings in Ukraine, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Kosovo,
          Lebanon, Azerbaijan, Haiti and Western Europe. She has used her business development and
          management skills to establish and lead a number of telecom operations.

          Her expertise and experience of network building, swaps and optimisation is of significant value to
          those entering the telecoms and mobile telecoms sectors. Her knowledge of revenue management
          through effective distribution network optimisation is also in high demand.

          Ineke says transparency, diplomacy and cultural sensitivity are indispensable skills that need to
          complement academic knowledge in order to achieve broad and long-lasting success: “In complex
          and challenging situations, only well-prepared executives with the right attitude and approach to risk
          will produce successful and rewarding businesses.”</span>

        </div>
        <p>“Keeping your personal radar on full, all the time, helps managers better understand
          situations, adapt accordingly and balance business objectives with local sensitivities.”</p>
        <span>Gavin has worked in some of the most politically-charged countries in the world including
          Afghanistan, Kosovo, Pakistan, Latvia, Papua New Guinea, Russia and Malawi - and often at times of
          conflict or post-conflict recovery.<br /><br />

          His 25 year plus exposure as a CEO and CFO in mobile and fixed telecoms has given him a wealth of
          experience that he shares with clients charged with new challenges such as start-ups and change
          management projects.<br /><br />

          Enabling others to make a lasting difference is where he believes Wyze2 adds real value: “Being
          faced with the unknown can make for ineffective leadership; we help executives understand how
          they can thrive in alien environments by listening, analysing the risks carefully, reading situations
          accurately and understanding what’s important.”<br /><br />

          Gavin has first-hand experience of physical, political and corruption challenges where they have the
          potential to seriously impact or even close down operations. He helps clients make well-informed
          pre-entry risk decisions by sharing his knowledge of how threats can manifest themselves and
          impact investment plans.<br /><br />

          Resourcefulness, awareness and recognition of local motivations and abilities are skills Gavin has
          applied to many international appointments. He believes greater individual and project resilience
          can be built when executives learn how to interpret early information and build useful risk profiles.</span>
